For this quiz 1 part 2 code,

I did everything i learned and done for the open weather API and used all of that infomration to put in thie currency conversions. I got the API URL and implemented that. I have also got the data from the currency API so that the conversions are correct. I used a div class dedeicated for the 5 buttons to toggle each of the conversions. With that, i used CSS to add creativity within it using the color green because money is green LOL. sorry. anyways yes, i implemented the features that i used such as functions, asynch functions, and even used an if else staement to help with displaying the conversions. The sources i used are below !!!
