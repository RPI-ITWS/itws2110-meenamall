Lab 3 - Weather/Cat API

Readme:

In this lab, I have learned a great amount. First off, I had zero idea of what an API was and what does and API provide. And to be honest with you, I didnt even know what API stood for. But right away, after reading the Lab 3 instructions, I did my research on an API and its value. From that, I understood a generic meaning of an API - generates current value. With that, I understood the point of this lab. At first I had difficulties of how to get the data from an API. I had trouble with understanding implementing the key into the apiurl but I did my research and found resources that helped me alot (cited sources below). I also learned alot more on the aspect of json and fetching. In intro, I got a general understanding of what it means to fetch, but after this lab, I understand the importance of fetching. I also enjoyed implementing aspects that I learned from intro like using constants, document.querySelector, fetch, etc. I now have a better understanding of these functions and when and why we use them. After implementing my first API(weather app) which potrays the current weather in Troy, NY, I wanted to implement another API that would make the viewers or users smile/laugh. With that, I wanted to use a cat API which generates a cat each time you click the button. My thought process here was that I wanted to user/viewer to smile after seeing the weather whether the weather is currently good or bad in Troy NY. And that is why I wanted to use a cat API rather than other API's that show general information. In this process I didnt have that much trouble than I expected. I did have trouble with understanding the implementation of the API/API Key but after that, I didnt have trouble with making the app look more creative and fun! I really enjoyed this lab and played around with it and really liked my outcome. 

Thank you so much!
